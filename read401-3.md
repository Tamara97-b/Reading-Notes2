# Maps 

### a map contain value in the basis of the key and value pair each key and value is known as entry
### amap is usefull if you need to update Asearch, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.

### a map doesn't allow duplicate keys, but you can have duplicate values. HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.

### map can't be traversed, so you need to convert it into Set using keySet() or entrySet() method.
## there are to type of maps 
### map 
### sorted map 

## and have three classes 
### hash map :  is  the implementation of Map, but it doesn't maintain any order.
### linked hash map :is  the implementation of Map. It inherits HashMap class. It maintains insertion order.
### tree map : it is implementation of sorted map and map 

### there are alot of method its useful for the map 
### V put(Object key, Object value):to insert an entry
### void putAll(Map map):to rntry spicified map 
### V putIfAbsent(K key, V value):to entry spicified value in the key 

# permitives 

## its int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, and char
### they are directly stored in the stack

### int: The default value of an int declared without an assignment is 0.
### If the variable is defined in a method, we must assign a value before we can use it.

### byte: its take 8 bite in the meomory and the default value of this permiteves is 0

### short: 

### long : its simillar to int but take more byte than int 

### float: its for decimal number and take 32 bites

### double:its precise decmal number and take 64 bites in meomory 

### boolean: it take 2 value as we know true and false and it stored in on one bit 

### char: to take the string and its take 16 bit

### The java.io package contains every class you might  need to perform input and output 1 and 0 in Java. All these streams represent an input source and an output destination. The stream in the java.io package supports many data such as primitives, object, localized characters.
