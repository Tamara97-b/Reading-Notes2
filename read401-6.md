# Interface 
### blueprint of a class It has static constants and abstract methods.

### The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body.
### to achive abstraction and multiple inhertance

## i used intrface for 3 reason :
###  to achieve abstraction.
###  we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
### achieve loose coupling.

## how can i declare the interfaces:
### it declared by inheritance krywords and the method will be in an empty body and this is example of how can you declare interfaces
### interface <interface_name>{  
      
###     // declare constant fields  
 ###    // declare methods that abstract   
 ###    // by default.  
### }  
### the interface extends interface and emplement the class

# Inheritance 

### class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class) its mean have parent and chids the child inhertiant the method and the variable from the parent and you can add for these method another methods or any thing who want 
 ### this is an example for the inheritance 

 ### the parent 
 public class Bicycle {
        
    // the Bicycle class has three fields
    public int cadence;
    public int gear;
    public int speed;
        
    // the Bicycle class has one constructor
    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
        gear = startGear;
        cadence = startCadence;
        speed = startSpeed;
    }
        
    // the Bicycle class has four methods
    public void setCadence(int newValue) {
        cadence = newValue;
    }
        
    public void setGear(int newValue) {
        gear = newValue;
    }
        
    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
    }
        
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
    }
        
}

### and this is the child 

public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {
        
    // the MountainBike subclass adds one field
    public int seatHeight;

    // the MountainBike subclass has one constructor
    public MountainBike(int startHeight,
                        int startCadence,
                        int startSpeed,
                        int startGear) {
        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);
        seatHeight = startHeight;
    }   
        
    // the MountainBike subclass adds one method
    public void setHeight(int newValue) {
        seatHeight = newValue;
    }   
}
##  what you can do in inhertanced: 

### The inherited (child ) can be used directly
### You can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it (not recommended).
### You can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
### The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
### You can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it.
### You can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.
### You can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
### You can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.
