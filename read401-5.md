# big O 
### its for analysis the Algorathem efficieny and its depend on two thing
## the time of the function need to complete  and its call time efficiancy 
## the space of meomory that the variabel and instruction of  function takes space efficiancy  

### the big O provided the woerst case depend on (Input SizeUnits ,  Measurement,Orders of GrowthBest Case, Worst Case, and Average Case)

### input size : refer to the size of the parameter and its value that mean if the value in big it will affect the algorathem efficiancy ( increse running time and space ) 

### unit of measurement : the big O determine the run time of the Algorathem depend on the time in ml need the function to execute and we  shouuld take the quality of machine in considered ,the huge fun which take most time of the algorathem , the space which take it during the whole process of execution 

### order of growth :describe overall efficiency by using the input size n and measuring the overall Units of Space and Time required for the given input size n. As the value of n grows, the Order of Growth represents the increase in Running Time or Memory Space.

### the worest middle best case : the worest define worest possible of input size .
### the middle :the middle define middle possible of input size
### the best :the best define best  possible of input size

# the linked list 
### sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.
## an example :LinkedList Methods
### Method	Description	
### addLast()	Add an item to the end of the list	
### removeFirst()	Remove an item from the beginning of the list.	
### removeLast()	Remove an item from the end of the list	
### getFirst()	Get the item at the beginning of the list
