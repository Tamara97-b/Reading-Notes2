## Who is Roy Fielding?
Roy Thomas Fielding (born 1965) is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.
## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has revolutionalized the world as we know it in the past decade. The information explosion has resulted in the collection of massive amounts of data, especially by large companies such as Facebook and Google. This amount of data, coupled with the rapid development of processor power and computer parallelization, has now made it possible to obtain and study huge amounts of data with relative ease.
## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.
## What does a GET do?
GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

GET is one of the most common HTTP methods.
## What does a POST do?
 POST (Power-On Self-Test) is the diagnostic testing sequence that a computer's basic input/output system (or "starting program") runs to determine if the computer keyboard, random access memory, disk drives, and other hardware are working correctly.
## What does PUT do?
method is used to update resource available on the server.
## What does PATCH do?
request method applies partial modifications to a resource.
