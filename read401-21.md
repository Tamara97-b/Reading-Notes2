### key classes(classes to create dynamic list)

* RecyclerView: its to view like any other element in the UI

* RecyclerView.view holder object: Each element is defined by a view holder object which is defined by extending

* RecyclerView.Adapter: You define methods in the adapter which get called by the RecyclerView by extending

* LayoutManager: is an abstract class that arranges the individual element in the list

### Steps for implementing your RecyclerView

1) Decide the look of the layout

2) Design how each element is going to look and behave

3) Define the Adapter that associates the data with the ViewHolder

### Planing the layout( layout mangers provided by the RecyclerView library )

LinearLayoutManger: arranges  in one direction

GridLayoutManger: arranges  in two direction

StaggeredGridLayoutManager: doesnâ€™t require same height for the elements in vertical grid or same width in horizontal grid

### Implementing your adapter and view holder

* viewHolder is a wrapper around a View that contains the layout for an individual item in the list

* adapter creates ViewHolder objects as needed, and also sets the data for those views

* the method of adapter: 1)onCreateViewHolder()
                         2)onBindViewHolder()
                         3)getItemCount()
