# Spring RESTful Routing  Static Files
1) @RequestMapping Basics:
The HTTP method parameter has no default value that means if we didn’t specify a value, it’s going to map to any HTTP request.
2) @RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = RequestMethod.GET) As we see in the method we can specify the type of HTTP requests by typing RequestMethod. and put the type of HTTP requests after the dot.
RequestMapping and HTTP Headers:
The 
3) @RequestMapping annotation provides a header element to narrow down the request mapping based on headers present in the request. Also we can indicate multiple header values.
The special use of this feature comes in the case of media types.
Starting with Spring 3.1, the @RequestMapping annotation now has the produces and consumes attributes.
RequestMapping With Path Variables:
4) @PathVariable is an annotation which indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a URI template variable. If the method parameter is Map<String, String> then the map is populated with all path variable names and values.
RequestMapping With Request Parameters:
5)@RequestParam annotation is used with @RequestMapping to bind a web request parameter to the parameter of the handler method.
The @RequestParam annotation can be used with or without a value. The value specifies the request param that needs to be mapped to the handler method parameter.
## Accessing Data with JPA
This guide walks you through the process of building an application that uses Spring Data JPA to store and retrieve data in a relational database.
Define a Simple Entity
In this example, you store Customer objects, each annotated as a JPA entity. The following listing shows the Customer class (in src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatajpa/Customer.java):
package com.example.accessingdatajpa;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
@Entity
public class Customer {
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
  private Long id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;

  protected Customer() {}

  public Customer(String firstName, String lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
