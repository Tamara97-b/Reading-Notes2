# general code design princibles
### its for use the less number of line code in your project 
### DRY : its mean dont repeat you self (is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.)
## the point of DRY: if you have to modify the logic, you have to copy-paste all over the place. By having a non-repeated code, you only have to maintain the code in a single place. New logic and bug fixes can be made one place instead of many. This leads to a robust and dependable software.

## and the benifits of DRY 
* maintibality 
###  the logic of checking permission was repeated all over the code, it becomes difficult to fix issues that arise in the repeated code. When you fix a problem in one, you could easily forget to fix the problem in other occurrences.and  if you have to modify the logic, you have to copy-paste all over the place. By having non-repeated code, you only have to maintin the code in a single place. New logic and bug fixes can be made one place instead of many. This leads to a robust and dependable software.
* testing
### for the  integration tests  not manual testing. The more paths and functions you have to cover using the tests, the more code you have to write for tests. If code is not repeated, you just have to test one main path. Of course, different beheviors still need to be tested.
* cost
### If the management needs to be convinced regarding spending more time on improving the quality of code, this is it â€“ More code costs more. More code takes more people more time to maintain and to address bugs. More time to develop and more bugs leads to a very unhappy customer.
* reuse
### DRY inherently promotes reuse of code because we are merging 2 or more instances of repeating code into a single block of code. Reusable code pays of in the long run as it speeds development time.
* readability
###  is more readable this is not because of the DRY principle itself, but rather because of the extra effort the developer put in to the code to make it follow certain principles such as DRY.
