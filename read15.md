MERN:MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. MongoDB - document database. Express(.js) - Node.js web framework. React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework.

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug
React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. The powerful Node.js runtime environment has been ranked the technology most commonly used by professional developers. Node.js is an event-driven JavaScript runtime. Node has myriad potential uses for JavaScript development including being a great environment for building efficient network applications.
