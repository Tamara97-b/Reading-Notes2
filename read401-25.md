# Serverless and Amplify

* serverless :is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider.

* Serverless applications are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service).

### the diffrences between traditional way Vs serverless

* the major advantages of using Serverless is reduced cost, for years the cost of provisioning servers and maintaining that 24x7 server team which blew a hole in your pocket is gone. The cost model of Serverless is execution-based: you’re charged for the number of executions.

* the downside is that Serverless functions are accessed only as private APIs. To access these you must set up an API Gateway.

* the serverless need independenceis

* With Serverless computing, there’s a hard 300-second timeout limit. Too complex or long-running functions aren’t good for Serverless, but having a hard timeout makes it impossible to perform certain tasks.

* Principles of FaaS:(function as a service )

1- Complete management of servers

2- Invocation based billing

3- Event-driven and instantaneously scalable

* Key properties of FaaS:
Independent, server-side, logical functions

### the serverless app:
* consists of a web server, Lambda functions (FaaS), security token service (STS), user authentication and database.
