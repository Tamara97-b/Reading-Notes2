## What Is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

### React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### React is used to build single page applications.

### React allows us to create reusable UI components.
## React Components
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Class components.

Create a Class Component
When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.

The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.
