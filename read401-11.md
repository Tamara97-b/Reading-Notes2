###  Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The frameworkâ€™s core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform.
## Spring MVC
###  Web model-view-controller (MVC) framework is designed around a Dispatcher Servant that dispatches requests to handlers, with configurable handler mappings, view resolution, locale and theme resolution as well as support for uploading files.
## java Spring Boot (Spring Boot): is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier through three core capabilities:
* Autoconfiguration
* An opinionated approach to configuration
* The ability to create standalone applications
### These features work together to provide you with a tool that allows you to set up a Spring-based application with minimal configuration and setup.

### Steps to configure and run your first app:
* from this link https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/#scratch
* navigate to https://start.spring.io. This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
* choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
* click Dependencies and select Spring Web, Thymeleaf, and Spring Boot DevTools.
* click Generate.
* download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.
or you can clone this link: git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-serving-web-content.git
* then cd into gs-serving-web-content/initial
* then create the web controller by make new class as will be as this path: src/main/java/com/example/servingwebcontent/GreetingController.java
