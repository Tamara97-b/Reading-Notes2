# Array 
### Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

### To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets: String[] cars;

### String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
### array of integer  int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};

## Access the Elements of an Array
### You access an array element by referring to the index number.
### This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:

## Example
### String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
### System.out.println(cars[0]);
## Change an Array Element
### To change the value of a specific element, refer to the index number:

### Example
### String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
### cars[0] = "Opel";
### System.out.println(cars[0]);
### // Now outputs Opel instead of Volvo

# the loop 
 ### looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.

### Java provides different types of loops to fit any programming need. Each loop has its own purpose and a suitable use case to serve.

## Simple for loop
###  A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

## While loop
### The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true
## Do-While loop
### The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.

# import 
### To import java package into a class, we need to use java import keyword which is used to access package and its classes into the java program. Use import to access built-in and user-defined packages into your java source file so that your class can refer to a class that is in another package by directly using its name.

### Imports: three options
### import javax.swing.*;  // Make all classes visible altho only one is used.
### import javax.swing.JOptionPane;  // Make a single class visible.
### class ImportTest {  javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hi");
