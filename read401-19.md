# Android Fundamentals
* There are languages that are using to implement Android app such as, kotlin, java and c++.
* APK is an Android package that archives file with an .apk suffix that will be used with Android SDK to compile the code.
* One APK file contains all the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.
### An Android app can be protected by:
* The Android operating system
* Permissions that the system sets for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.
* Virtual machine (VM).
* The Android system implements the principle of least privilege:
Each app can access only to the components that it requires to do its work to complete the work of the app, which means that the app cannot access any parts of the system even if it has a permission.

### App components :
App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app.

### Activities.
* An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface.

* An activity facilitates the following key interactions between system and app:
1- Keeping track of what the user currently cares about (what is on screen) to ensure that the system keeps running the process that is hosting the activity.
2- Knowing that previously used processes contain things the user may return to (stopped activities), and thus more highly prioritize keeping those processes around.
3- Helping the app handle having its process killed so the user can return to activities with their previous state restored.
4- Providing a way for apps to implement user flows between each other, and for the system to coordinate these flows. (The most classic example here being share.)

### Services.
A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. A service does not provide a user interface.

### Broadcast receivers.

A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. Because broadcast receivers are another well-defined entry into the app, the system can deliver broadcasts even to apps that aren't currently running.
