# Graph

* A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

* Common terminology used when working with Graphs:
1- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

2- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

3- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

4- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

* Directed vs Undirected
Undirected Graphs
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

Vertices/Nodes = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

Edges = {(a,c),(a,d),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,e),(e,f)}

* Directed Graphs (Digraph)
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Vertices = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

Edges = {(a,c),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,a),(d,e)(e,c)(e,f)}

* Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

* Complete Graphs:complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
Connected Graphs

* Connected Graphs:graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
Disconnected Graphs

* disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

* Acyclic vs Cyclic

* Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

When a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

* Cyclic Graphs

A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

A path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
