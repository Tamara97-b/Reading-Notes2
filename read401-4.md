# oop 
## object orianted programming
### the oop related to ( classes, object, inheritance, interfacese , and packages )


### the object is to model the things by its behavior and its properties
### an example of object :the bycicle which have methods(change the gear , brake ) and have alot of properties (color shape of cycling ........)

### classes its a blueprint for the object which model thing 
### an example of 
classes class Bicycle {

    int cadence = 0;
    int speed = 0;
    int gear = 1;

    void changeCadence(int newValue) {
         cadence = newValue;
    }

    void changeGear(int newValue) {
         gear = newValue;
    }

    void speedUp(int increment) {
         speed = speed + increment;   
    }

    void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
         speed = speed - decrement;
    }

    void printStates() {
         System.out.println("cadence:" +
             cadence + " speed:" + 
             speed + " gear:" + gear);
    }
}

### inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.
### an example the bicycle is the parent and the (mountine bike and road bike )are the childs which inherted the parent property and methods

### interfaces its the middle between classes and ihe interfaces
### an example 
class ACMEBicycle implements Bicycle {

    int cadence = 0;
    int speed = 0;
    int gear = 1;

   // The compiler will now require that methods
   // changeCadence, changeGear, speedUp, and applyBrakes
   // all be implemented. Compilation will fail if those
   // methods are missing from this class.

    void changeCadence(int newValue) {
         cadence = newValue;
    }

    void changeGear(int newValue) {
         gear = newValue;
    }

    void speedUp(int increment) {
         speed = speed + increment;   
    }

    void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
         speed = speed - decrement;
    }

    void printStates() {
         System.out.println("cadence:" +
             cadence + " speed:" + 
             speed + " gear:" + gear);
    }
}

### packages  namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manne

# the decimle number 
### everynumer or deget in the decimal number have a position 
### The position just to the left of the point is the "Ones" position. 
### Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller
