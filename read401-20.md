# Intents, Activities, and SharedPreferences

* tasks are collections of activities that users interact with when trying to do something within the application.

* back stack is where these activities are stored in the order they were opened

* home screen(main actiity): the activity which app start where the user tapped the icon of the application .

* the process of the activity how it runs: When the current activity starts another, the new activity is pushed on the top of the stack and takes focus the previous activity remains in the stack but is stopped

* task can then return to the "foreground" so users can pick up where they left off.

* The user presses the Home button, then starts a new app from the app launcher.

* When the Home screen appears, Task A goes into the background.

* When the new app starts, the system starts a task for that app (Task B) with its own stack of activities.

* After interacting with that app, the user returns Home again and selects the app that originally started Task A. Now, Task A comes to the foregroundâ€”all three activities in its stack are intact and the activity at the top of the stack resumes.

* At this point, the user can also switch back to Task B by going Home and selecting the app icon that started that task (or by selecting the app's task from the Recents screen)
