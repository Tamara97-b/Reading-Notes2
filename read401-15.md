# Spring Authentication

### the diffrence between authentication and autharization the authentication is who are you? and (what are you allowed to do?) and have another name access control.pring Security has an architecture that is designed to separate authentication from authorization and has strategies and extension points for both.

### the main method of authentication is:
public interface AuthenticationManager {

  Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
    throws AuthenticationException;
} 

### the 3 method of authenticationmanger:
* Return an Authentication (normally with authenticated=true) if it can verify that the input represents a valid principal.

* Throw an AuthenticationException if it believes that the input represents an invalid principal.

* Return null if it cannot decide.

### the most commonly used implementation of AuthenticationManager is ProviderManager, which delegates to a chain of AuthenticationProvider instances.

### An AuthenticationProvider is a bit like an AuthenticationManager, but it has an extra method to allow the caller to query whether it supports a given Authentication type:

public interface AuthenticationProvider {

	Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
			throws AuthenticationException;

	boolean supports(Class<?> authentication);

}

### Authorization or Access Control

## Once authentication is successful, we can move on to authorization, and the core strategy here is AccessDecisionManager. There are three implementations provided by the framework and all three delegate to a chain of AccessDecisionVoter instances, a bit like the ProviderManager delegates to AuthenticationProviders.

boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute);

boolean supports(Class<?> clazz);

int vote(Authentication authentication, S object,
        Collection<ConfigAttribute> attributes);
