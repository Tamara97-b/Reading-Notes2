* Cognito is the authentication and autherication framework provided by AWS which takes only few lines of code to get it working.

* Configurations

* To add cognito to your application you use the command amplify add auth then use your preferred settings

* Use the command amplify push to apply the changes to the cloud backend server

* Implement the required dependencies in the gradle.build file implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.29.0'

* Add the plugin to the amplify configurations Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())

* Now that you have configured AWS Cognito you can use it wherever you want within your application

* Code Example

* Now lets dive in the process of authentication using Cognito

* Register a new user

AuthSignUpOptions options = AuthSignUpOptions.builder()
   .userAttribute(AuthUserAttributeKey.email(), "my@email.com")
   .build();
Amplify.Auth.signUp("username", "Password123", options,
   result -> Log.i("AuthQuickStart", "Result: " + result.toString()),
   error -> Log.e("AuthQuickStart", "Sign up failed", error)
);

* after regestration the user needs to confirm his identity either using email or sms sent to the phone number

* Confirmation

Amplify.Auth.confirmSignUp(
   "username",
   "the code you received via email",
   result -> Log.i("AuthQuickstart", result.isSignUpComplete() ? "Confirm signUp succeeded" : "Confirm sign up not complete"),
   error -> Log.e("AuthQuickstart", error.toString())
);

// the code below can be used to resend the confirmation code

Amplify.Auth.resendUserAttributeConfirmationCode(AuthUserAttributeKey.email(),
    result -> Log.i("AuthDemo", "Code was sent again: " + result.toString()),
    error -> Log.e("AuthDemo", "Failed to resend code.", error)
);

* User SignIn

Amplify.Auth.signIn(
    "username",
    "password",
    result -> Log.i("AuthQuickstart", result.isSignInComplete() ? "Sign in succeeded" : "Sign in not complete"),
    error -> Log.e("AuthQuickstart", error.toString())
);

* Fetching User Attributes
* To get authenticated user data we can do the following

Amplify.Auth.fetchUserAttributes(
    attributes -> Log.i("AuthDemo", "User attributes = " + attributes.toString()),
    error -> Log.e("AuthDemo", "Failed to fetch user attributes.", error)
);

* Signing out
To sign out of the session do the following

Amplify.Auth.signOut(
    () -> Log.i("AuthQuickstart", "Signed out successfully"),
    error -> Log.e("AuthQuickstart", error.toString())
);
