# WRRC and java
# HTTP 
### The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web.
### protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. 

## HTTP Request Lifecycle

* Local Processing:Browser will then go through its own cache of recently accessed URLs, the operating system’s cache of recent queries, router’s cache, and DNS cache to extract the “scheme”/protocol, host, optional port number, resource path, and query strings that are given in the form.

* Resolve an IP:If the cache lookup fails, the browser sends a UDP3 DNS request to its target DNS server. If a response isn’t received, the request will be forwarded to another server. This is because the server looks for the address associated with the requested hostname and sends a response. If it doesn’t arrive, the client has no idea how long it will take.

* Establish a TCP Connection:Before the server can accept a three-way handshake, the client must first create a TCP connection. The server must be listening on a port and executing a passive open, after which the client can conduct an active open and the client-server connection will be recognized. This allows the receiver to restore the original order of received packets and the sender to restore the original order of sent packets.

* Send an HTTP Request:A request is submitted, consisting of a “request line,” a request header, and a body, and it passes through a routing mechanism. The server receives the request, analyzes it, and locates the requested resource before returning an HTTP response. The server generates a response and responds to the request.

Local Processing

* Tearing Down and Cleaning Up:After receiving the response, the client sends a TCP FIN packet, to which the server answers with an ACK, and then sends its own FIN, to which the client responds with its own ACK signal. Then there will be a timeout. The four-way handshake is what it’s called. The browser begins to process the information it has received and then exits.


## Way of performing HTTP requests in Java
* Add Request Parameters
* Setting Request Headers
* Configuring Timeouts
* Handling Cookies
* Handling Redirects
* Reading the Response
* Reading the Response on Failed Requests
* Building the Full Response
* Add Request Parameters
