# what is java

### One of the most widely used programming languages, Java is used as the server-side language for most back-end development projects, including those involving big data and Android development. Java is also commonly used for desktop computing, other mobile computing, games, and numerical computing.

## variables

### Instance Variables( that is, fields declared without the static keyword. Non-static fields are also known as instance variables because their values are unique to each instance of a class (to each object, in other words);)

### Class Variables( one copy of this variable in existence,)
### Local Variables(s, a method will often store its temporary state in local variables)
### Parameters (accepting constructs)

## Operators
### postfix :	expr++ expr--
### unary	:++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
### multiplicative:	* / %
### additive:	+ -
### shift	:<< >> >>>
### relational:	< > <= >= instanceof
### equality	:== !=
### bitwise :AND	&
### bitwise exclusive :OR	^
### bitwise inclusive :OR	|
### logical :AND	&&
### logical: OR	||
### ternary	:? :
### assignment:	= += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

## Expressions
### An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value. You've already seen examples of expressions, illustrated in bold below:

### int cadence = 0;
### anArray[0] = 100;
### System.out.println("Element 1 at index 0: " + anArray[0]);

### int result = 1 + 2; // result is now 3
### if (value1 == value2) 
   ### System.out.println("value1 == value2");
   
## Statements
### Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. The following types of expressions can be made into a statement by terminating the expression with a semicolon (;)
 
## Blocks
### a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.

## Control Flow Statements
### The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code. This section describes the decision-making statements (if-then, if-then-else, switch), the looping statements (for, while, do-while), and the branching statements (break, continue, return) supported by the Java programming language.

# A compiler
###  is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses. Typically, a programmer writes language statements in a language such as Pascal or C one line at a time using an editor.
