# Intents, Activities, and SharedPreferences
### Tasks and Back Stack
* A task is a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job. The activities are arranged in a stack—the back stack)—in the order in which each activity is opened. For example, an email app might have one activity to show a list of new messages. When the user selects a message, a new activity opens to view that message. This new activity is added to the back stack. If the user presses the Back button, that new activity is finished and popped off the stack.

* The device Home screen is the starting place for most tasks. When the user touches an icon in the app launcher (or a shortcut on the Home screen), that app’s task comes to the foreground. If no task exists for the app (the app has not been used recently), then a new task is created and the “main” activity for that app opens as the root activity in the stack.

* When the current activity starts another, the new activity is pushed on the top of the stack and takes focus. The previous activity remains in the stack, but is stopped. When an activity stops, the system retains the current state of its user interface. 

The way Android manages tasks and the back stack, as described above—by placing all activities started in succession in the same task and in a "last in, first out" stac.

However, you might decide that you want to interrupt the normal behavior. Perhaps you want an activity in your app to begin a new task when it is started (instead of being placed within the current task); or, when you start an activity, you want to bring forward an existing instance of it (instead of creating a new instance on top of the back stack); or, you want your back stack to be cleared of all activities except for the root activity when the user leaves the task.

* You can do these things and more, with attributes in the <activity> manifest element and with flags in the intent that you pass to startActivity().

* In this regard, the principal <activity> attributes you can use are:

 taskAffinity

launchMode

allowTaskReparenting

clearTaskOnLaunch

alwaysRetainTaskState

finishOnTaskLaunch

* And the principal intent flags you can use are:

FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK

FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP

FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP
