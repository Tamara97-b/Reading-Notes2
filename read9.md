## What is functional programming?
 is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
 is a function which: Given the same input, always returns the same output. Produces no side effects.
## What are the benefits of a pure function?
Pure functions are much easier to read and reason about. All relevant inputs and dependencies are provided as parameters, so no effects are observed that alter variables outside of the set of inputs. This means that we can quickly understand a function and its dependencies, just by reading the function's declaration.
## What is immutability?
Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and therefore cannot be changed). if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x. But you cannot change the value of 3.14. Value
## What is Referential transparency?
are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior.[1] This requires that the expression be pure, that is to say the expression value must be the same for the same inputs and its evaluation must have no side effects. An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque.
## What is a module?
 a standard or unit of measurement. 2 : the size of some one part taken as a unit of measure by which the proportions of an architectural composition are regulated. 3a : any in a series of standardized units for use together: such as. (1) : a unit of furniture or architecture.
## What does the word ‘require’ do?
is used to load and cache JavaScript modules. So, if you want to load a local, relative JavaScript module into a Node. js application, you can simply use the require() method.
## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
Functions in one module can be imported and called in other modules saving you from having to copy function definitions into the other files. A module can be edited or debugged separately making it easier for you to add or remove new features
## What do we have to do to make a module available?
Create a new module — In the Create New Module window that appears, ... appropriate code templates you can select to use as your main activity.
