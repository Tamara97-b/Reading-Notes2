# Trees

### its type of data structure that have common termonalgy :


* node :the place who contain the value and connect to other one.
* right : refers to the other child .
* left :refers to one child .
* root:the first element in tree.
* height: the number of the edge .
* edge: the link between child and parent .
* leaf : node havent child . 
* k : max num of children in any node .

### the important aspect for tree is traversal 

the traversal allow you to print the content , and search for node in the tree .

### to type of trvesal :

* depth first :Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root

* breadth first :Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.


Big O
The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n).
Searching for a specific node will also be O(n), worst case we will have to look at n items, hence the O(n) complexity.
The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion will be O(w), where w is the largest width of the tree.
A perfect binary tree is one where every non-leaf node has exactly two children. The maximum width for a perfect binary tree, is 2^(h-1), where h is the height of the tree. Height can be calculated as log n, where n is the number of nodes.
Binary Search Trees (BST)
In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
