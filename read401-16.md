# Spring Authorization

## There are several samples building on each other, adding new features at each step:

* simple: a very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login via Spring Boot’s OAuth 2.0 configuration properties (if you visit the home page, you will be automatically redirected to GitHub).
* click: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.
* logout: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.
* two-providers: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.
* custom-error: adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication based on GitHub’s API.

### Each app can be imported into an IDE.
### The apps all work on localhost:8080 because they’ll use OAuth 2.0 clients registered with GitHub and Google for that address.

### How to Single Sign On With GitHub
* Creating a New Project
* Add a Home Page
* Securing the Application with GitHub and Spring Security to make the application secure.
* Add a New GitHub app
* Configure application.yml
* Boot up the application
* You can use logout as an endpoint and CSRF Token in the Client.
* Login with GitHub

### Securing the Application with GitHub and Spring Security To make the application secure, you can simply add Spring Security as a dependency. Since you’re wanting to do a “social” login (delegate to GitHub), you should include the Spring Security OAuth 2.0 Client starter:

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
