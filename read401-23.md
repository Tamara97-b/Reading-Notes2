# Hashtables

* the hash :we use it to convert string in the array into value and determine the index of an array for security perpose.

* Buckets :the content of an index . 

* Collisions :is what happend when multiple there are multiple key in same index .

* we use hash,bucket and collision to hold uniqe value ,dictionary and library

* hash table is to provide a direct access to its items. So that is why the it calculates the (hash code) of the key and uses it to store the item, instead of the key itself.

* the complexity O(1) for time and for search O(n).
* the complexity O(1) for space . 

### implementation 

* hash map uses a “hash function” to place each item at a precise index location, based off it’s key.

* hash function should always return the same output for the same input
* In a perfect hash table where there is no collisions when given an integer that represents the index of the data in the array you can easily and efficiently jump to that location and grab what you need.

* Sadly in this reality there is nothing perfect so collision are bound to happen, collisions are solved by using multiple options, for an example we can use buckets that start with a linked list instead of a null

###  the methods of hash tables:
1) Add()
 
* send the key to the GetHash method.
* Once you determine the index of where it should be placed, go -to that index
* Check if something exists at that index already, if it doesn’t, add it with the key/value pair.
* If something does exist, add the new key/value pair to the data structure within that bucket.
2) Find()
3) Contains() 
4) GetHash()
